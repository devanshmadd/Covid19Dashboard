# covid19Dashboard
Covid19 Dashboard using Highcharts API and newsAPI.org 
Download the file and unzip it.
Open the folder in the visual studio code.
Use a live server extension.
And then go live using that.
There is an error with the NewsAPI.org, it is forbidden because has been called too many times. 
But I have made a separate html file to show the working of newsapi.org so there is a file named newsapi.html, and running it separately is working fine.
Other than that, the features are as per asked.
